## Measuring Success and Impact

While quantifying the direct ROI of brand prominence in airport advertising can be complex, several metrics and observations suggest NRMA Insurance's strategy is highly effective:

*   **Perceived Market Leadership:** A dominant presence can create the perception that NRMA Insurance is a leading, reliable, and financially stable company.
*   **Website Traffic and Enquiries:** While not directly attributable solely to airport ads, a strong OOH presence can drive online searches and direct inquiries, especially for travel-related products.
*   **Consumer Surveys:** Market research often includes questions about where consumers have seen advertising, providing insights into the effectiveness of different channels.
